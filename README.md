Memex Monorepo
==============

Various software components I use, mostly built using Flutter and maintained in this monorepo.

Most of the components are Linux desktop applications and may be tailored to my specific NixOS setup, limiting their usability for others.
Some components are more general.
There will also be applications targeting Android.
